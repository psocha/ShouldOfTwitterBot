# Should Of Detector

A simple Twitter bot written in node.js. It periodically polls Twitter to look for instances of the grammatically-incorrect phrase "should of". It then writes the authors of those tweets a stern reply telling them that the correct phrase to use is "should have".

The Should Of Detector is currently active on Twitter as the user [@ShouldOfBot](http://twitter.com/ShouldOfBot/with_replies).

Integration with the Twitter API is done with the help of the [twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) npm package.
